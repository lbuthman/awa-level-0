## Howdy!

This package contains a wild, but not atypical, state of Apex automation. The logic is complex, the design choices are
inconsistent, and tests lack a greater purpose beyond merely code coverage. When Apex code, design, and architecture
fall into this level, what I call Level 0, every change, bug fix, or question that needs to be answered about it
takes longer and is less certain. All this equates to a higher cost of development.

That said, the code in this org represents hundreds of hours of Apex development and investment by "the business". The
worst thing a team or business could do would be to "burn it down" and start over. Doing it "right this time". The 
tougher reality is that code entropy and technical debt are natural byproducts of development. They cannot be factored
out of the SDLC, but instead must be factored in. They will happen, as certain as death and taxes.

Therefore, our goal is to learn how to work with, transform, and manage the inherent complexity of this level of code. 
The better we are at turning rotten, collapsed, and complex code into simple, readable, and maintainable, the better 
value we will provide to the businesses we work for.

This package can be used as a training ground to learn essential skills in refactoring towards understanding and 
redesigning Apex towards higher levels of design. It provides a resource to practice maintenance skills in a safe
environment, where you don't have to worry about breaking production business processes.
